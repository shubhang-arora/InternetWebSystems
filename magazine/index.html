                China is going to launch the world's first nuclear power plant, the Sanmen Nuclear Power Station, that is immune to meltdown. The US and China jointly invested over ₹38,000 crore for building the reactor used in the plant.

                Sweden-based chemists have revealed adding water to whisky boosts the concentration of flavour compounds by unleashing the rich mix of aromas. Whisky is distilled to around 70% alcohol by volume and then diluted to about 40% prior bottling. Further diluting it to 27% boosts the density of flavour-giving compound guaiacol at the surface by over one-third, said researchers.
